# RBS_2009
Time synchronization implementation for wireless sensor networks using RBS protocol. Video description can be found in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um9xJE7fmUk

The RCV.nc, RCVAppC.nc, SND.nc, & SNDAppC.nc files were written for TelosB motes in 2009. These files should be enough if using similar hardware. However, the compiler at that time created additional C files; if these files are required, please contact me.

Refer to "Project Report.pdf" <https://github.com/faisal3r/RBS_2009/blob/master/Project%20Report.pdf> for more details and protocol description.
